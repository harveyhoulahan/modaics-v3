## AREA ANALYSIS: THE 7 INTERSECTION ZONES

### 1. CIRCULAR FASHION AI (Textile Waste & Lifecycle)
**What it is:** AI systems that track, predict, and optimize garment lifecycles—from design for disassembly to automated sorting of used textiles to resale value prediction.

**Market Context:**
- Global textile waste: 92 million tonnes annually
- Only 1% of textiles are recycled into new garments (circular gap)
- EU Digital Product Passport (DPP) mandates coming 2027
- Australia: 800,000 tonnes textiles to landfill/year, government pressure mounting

**Current Players:**

- But: Most solutions are clunky, enterprise-focused, ugly

**What Makes It Unique for Harvey:**
- Fashion tech experience → understands garment data structures
- Blockchain traceability background (FibreTrace) → can integrate with DPP requirements
- Can build something beautiful (not another SAP module)

**Who Pays:**
- Mid-size sustainable brands ($50M-$500M revenue) who need DPP compliance
- Vintage/resale platforms needing automated pricing/condition assessment
- Textile recyclers needing automated sorting (huge bottleneck)

**Weekend-Startable:** ★★★★☆ (4/5)
- Can start with resale value prediction API
- Dataset: Depop, TheRealReal, Poshmark listings (scrapable)
- MVP: Single-brand pilot for automated resale pricing

**Three Pillars Leverage:** ★★★★★ (5/5)
- AI: Computer vision for condition assessment, NLP for style categorization, pricing models
- Design: Consumer-facing resale interface, brand storytelling around circularity
- Sustainability: Directly tackles textile waste, extends garment lifecycles
