# USER.md - About Harvey Houlahan

## Basics
- **Name:** Harvey Houlahan
- **What to call them:** Harvey
- **Pronouns:** (not specified yet)
- **Timezone:** Australia (implied from Monash, cotton farm near Moree)

## Context
### Communication Preference
Keep responses clean and professional: no emojis. Only allow 🐉 as the final-character signature.

### Academic Profile
- Advanced Computer Science (AI/ML stream) at Monash
- ~87+ WAM, 99.4 ATAR
- Deep engagement with: algorithms, ML modelling, parallel computing, architecture, probabilistic modelling, formal languages & automata
- Systems-level thinker, highly structured, references everything

### Background
- Grew up 50km west of Moree on a cotton farm
- Three brothers, performative/achievement-heavy family
- Gay kid in hyper-masculine environment → overperformance as protection
- Deep connection to agriculture, cotton, fibre supply chains, sustainability

### Entrepreneurial Identity
Aggressively vision-driven. Projects include:
- **Modaics** — AI digital wardrobe platform
- **FibreTrace** — iOS + blockchain integration
- **AgrIQ** — farm analytics
- **Synaptech Studios**
- AI trend forecasting tools
- Shopify dev modules
- Mixed media product display systems

Pattern: See inefficiency → imagine AI-enhanced structure → build architecture before validation → aim for global scale immediately.

Thinks in: New York, Berlin, Milan, Copenhagen, Byron, Gold Coast hinterland, global supply chains.

**Weakness:** Scope inflation. Architects before testing.

### Creative & Aesthetic Layer
- Cares deeply about fashion, wants to model
- Thinks in industrial grey/red UI aesthetics
- Loves clean, minimalist systems
- Comfortable holding AI infrastructure, blockchain, modelling portfolios, fashion storytelling, sustainable cotton — simultaneously

### Nervous System & Psychological Patterns
- Performance pressure, migraines, vertigo
- ADHD/OCD concerns, overthinking, hyper-drive cycles
- Runs very hot cognitively, operates in future-state projection constantly
- Baseline nervous system tone is elevated
- Trauma from boarding school, perfectionism, relationship validation patterns

**Need:** Shift from constant intensity to controlled intensity. Depth over breadth. Rest.

### Global Trajectory
- Exchange semesters, internships in Copenhagen
- Milan modelling, farmland near Byron
- Considers: quantum computing masters, architecture, robotics, commerce
- Wants: tech competence, creative expression, land ownership, global mobility, economic independence

### Technical Ambitions
LLM orchestration, local GPU servers, AI infrastructure, blockchain integrations, predictive modelling, time-series forecasting, hybrid filtering, reinforcement learning, supply chain traceability. Wants architecture-level AI, not surface-level API calls.

### How Harvey Uses Me
Like a: cofounder, research assistant, therapist, technical architect, proof-checker, branding strategist, property analyst, modelling consultant, systems designer, life optimiser.

Likes: iteration, refinement, structured output, HD-level detail, alignment with rubric/outcome.

Doesn't want comfort. Wants clarity.

### Strengths
Very high cognitive bandwidth, systems thinking, technical depth, entrepreneurial instinct, aesthetic intelligence, strategic long-term thinking, deep identity coherence, strong writing/communication, global ambition, high self-awareness.

### Risks (I Handle With Care)
- Burnout via overextension
- Chasing too many high-difficulty paths simultaneously
- Seeking validation through output volume
- Identity inflation (needing to be exceptional in every domain)
- Nervous system dysregulation from constant optimisation

He doesn't need to prove anything anymore. His internal model hasn't updated to that yet.
