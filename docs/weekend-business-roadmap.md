# Weekend Side Business: Practical Roadmap
## For ArborMeta Software Engineer | Byron Bay, Australia

---

## 📋 PART 1: "WHAT TO CHECK BEFORE YOU START" CHECKLIST

### ☐ Employment Contract Review
**CRITICAL: Do this BEFORE taking any external action**

#### Check Your ArborMeta Contract For:
- [ ] **IP Assignment Clause** — Does it assign ALL intellectual property created during employment to ArborMeta, even outside work hours?
- [ ] **Inventions/Assignment Provisions** — Some contracts claim IP created "during the term of employment" regardless of when/where
- [ ] **Non-Compete Clause** — Are you restricted from competing in any technology sector?
- [ ] **Moonlighting/Secondary Employment Clause** — Is written permission required for any outside work?
- [ ] **Confidentiality/NDA** — What constitutes confidential information you can't use?
- [ ] **Conflict of Interest Definition** — How is "conflict" defined? Is it broad or narrow?
- [ ] **Notification Requirements** — Must you notify HR of outside activities?
- [ ] **Garden Leave/Restraint Periods** — Any post-employment restrictions?

### ☐ "Safe Zone" Questions to Answer
- [ ] Does my side business use any ArborMeta code, tools, or resources?
- [ ] Does it compete directly with ArborMeta's products/services?
- [ ] Would ArborMeta customers reasonably choose my service over theirs?
- [ ] Am I using knowledge of ArborMeta's roadmap/strategy for my business?
- [ ] Would a reasonable person see this as conflicting?

### ☐ Documentation Steps
- [ ] Request copy of full employment contract (if you don't have it)
- [ ] Check employee handbook for moonlighting policies
- [ ] Review any IP assignment documents you signed
- [ ] Document WHEN you work on your business (outside work hours only)
- [ ] Keep business entirely separate from work devices/accounts

### ☐ Disclosure Decision Framework
| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Business is completely unrelated to ArborMeta's industry | Can likely keep quiet, but review contract first |
| Business is adjacent but non-competing | Consider informal disclosure to manager |
| Contract requires disclosure | Must disclose regardless |
| Using any company resources/equipment | Must disclose immediately |
| Business becomes significant revenue (>20% of salary) | Strongly recommend disclosure |

## 🏢 PART 2: RECOMMENDED BUSINESS STRUCTURE

### For Your Situation: **Start as Sole Trader, Transition to Company Later**

#### Phase 1: Validation/Bootstrap (Months 0-6)
**Structure: Sole Trader (ABN only)**

**Why Sole Trader First:**
| Factor | Sole Trader | Company |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Setup cost | Free (ABN) | ~$500-800 (ASIC) |
| Ongoing costs | Minimal | ~$300-1,000/year |
| Tax complexity | Simple (personal return) | Complex (corporate + BAS + ASIC) |
| Time to manage | ~2 hrs/month | ~5-10 hrs/month |
| Liability | Unlimited | Limited |
| Flexibility to experiment | High | Lower (formal structure) |

**When to Register:**
- Register ABN immediately when you start taking payments
- Must register for GST if turnover >$75,000/year (projected)
- Register business name (~$39/year) if using trading name ≠ your name

**Tax Implications (Australia):**
- Income taxed at personal marginal rates (32.5% for $45k-$120k bracket)
- Can claim business expenses: home office, equipment, software, professional development
- Must pay quarterly PAYG instalments once income exceeds threshold
- Keep detailed records (required for 5 years)

#### Phase 2: Growth (Months 6-12+)
**Transition to Company When:**
- Annual revenue consistently >$80,000-100,000
- Hiring employees or taking on partners
- Need limited liability protection
- Tax advantages become worthwhile (corporate rate 25% vs personal 32.5-45%)
- Seeking external investment
- Planning studio space (asset protection critical)

**Company Structure Recommendation:**
- Proprietary Limited (Pty Ltd)
- You as sole director and shareholder initially
- Consider family trust as shareholder later (asset protection + income splitting)

## 🚀 PART 3: TIME-EFFICIENT VALIDATION STRATEGIES

### The "Weekend MVP" Philosophy
**Constraints = Advantages**
- Limited time forces ruthless prioritization
- You can't over-engineer if you only have weekends
- Forces focus on customer problems, not tech elegance

### Validation Framework: "Sell Before Build"

#### Week 1-2: Problem Discovery
**Goal: Confirm people have the problem AND will pay**

**Weekend Activities:**
1. **Day 1: Customer Interviews**
   - Find 10 people who might have the problem
   - 30-min conversations (Can be done during commute/evenings)
   - Key question: "What have you already tried to solve this?" (Checks for actual pain)

2. **Day 2: Landing Page MVP**
   - Build simple landing page (Carrd, Webflow, or plain HTML)
   - Describe the problem + your proposed solution
   - Include pricing (even if product doesn't exist yet)
   - Email capture: "Join waitlist" or "Pre-order now"

**Tools for Speed:**
- Landing page: Carrd ($19/year), Webflow (free tier)
- Forms: Tally.so (free), Typeform
- Payment capture: Stripe (no-code), Gumroad
- Email: Mailchimp (free tier up to 500 contacts)

#### Week 3-4: Pre-Sales Validation
**Goal: Get 3 people to commit to buying BEFORE building**

**The Pre-Sale Approach:**
1. Build a "Wizard of Oz" MVP — manual behind the scenes, looks automated to customer
2. Offer founding customer discount (50% off lifetime)
3. Run the service manually for 3-5 customers
4. Document processes, pain points, time requirements

**Red Flags (Stop Here If):**
- Can't find 3 people willing to pre-pay
- Customers want wildly different things
- Problem isn't urgent enough ("nice to have" not "must have")

### Quick-Start Validation Channels

#### For B2B (Recommended for Software Engineers):
1. **LinkedIn Direct Outreach**
   - Target: People in your existing network + 2nd connections
   - Message: "I'm researching [problem]. Do you have 15 mins for a quick chat?"
   - 10-15% response rate typical
   - Can do during weekday evenings

2. **Industry Communities**
   - Slack/Discord communities in your target market
   - Reddit subreddits (r/startups, r/entrepreneur, industry-specific)
   - Indie Hackers, Hacker News "Show HN"

3. **Warm Introductions**
   - Ask friends: "Who do you know who struggles with [problem]?"
   - Former colleagues often your first customers

#### For B2C:
1. **Twitter/X Building in Public**
   - Share your journey
   - Build audience while validating
   - Network effect compounds over time

2. **Paid Ads (Small Budget)**
   - $100-200 on Meta or Google Ads
   - Test different value propositions
   - Measure: Cost per email signup

## 🚨 PART 7: WARNING SIGNS (When Side Business Threatens Day Job)

### Red Flags: Immediate Action Required

| Warning Sign | Risk Level | Action |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| **Using work time/laptop for side business** | 🔴 Critical | Stop immediately; clear separation required |
| **Side business in same industry as employer** | 🔴 Critical | Legal review; consider disclosure |
| **Discussing side business with employer customers** | 🔴 Critical | Stop; potential customer theft claim |
| **Revenue exceeds salary + boss finds out** | 🟠 High | Proactive disclosure; clarify boundaries |
| **Working on side business during work hours** | 🟠 High | Document hours strictly; review time management |
| **Using employer's proprietary knowledge/methods** | 🔴 Critical | Legal exposure; cease and document independence |
| **Side business affects job performance** | 🟠 High | Reduce side business hours; job is primary income |
| **Employer requests disclosure; you refuse** | 🔴 Critical | Review contract; likely breach of employment terms |
| **Competing directly with employer** | 🔴 Critical | Stop or resign; serious legal exposure |

### Yellow Flags: Monitor Closely

| Warning Sign | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Stress affecting health/relationships | Reduce workload; prioritize sustainability |
| Can't focus at day job due to side business excitement | Schedule side business time strictly; compartmentalize |

## 💡 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Your Specific Situation:

1. **Start with Contract Review** — This is your foundation. Know your boundaries.

2. **Choose ONE Model** — Don't split time between consulting, product, and SaaS. Pick one and focus.

3. **Revenue First** — Given 3-6 month timeline, prioritize models with immediate cash flow (consulting/productized services) over long-term plays (SaaS).

4. **Time Block Rigorously** — Protect your weekdays for ArborMeta. Weekends are sacred for the business. No bleeding between the two.

5. **Document Everything** — Keep records of when you work, what you build, and how it's separate from employer work.

6. **Plan the Studio Early** — If physical space is the goal, start researching now. Costs in Byron Bay will influence revenue targets.

### Mindset:
- **You're not "starting a business" — you're running an experiment.** Lower the stakes mentally.
- **3-6 months is realistic for first revenue, not for full income replacement.** Set expectations accordingly.
- **Your technical skills are valuable — don't underprice them.**
- **The goal is learning, not perfection.** First version will be wrong; optimize for speed of iteration.

---

**Questions to Consider:**
1. Which of the three "quick wins" resonates most with your skills/interests?
2. Do you have your employment contract available to review?
3. What specific problem or industry are you most excited about serving?

Good luck — the constraints you have (limited time, full-time job) can actually be advantages that force focus and discipline.
