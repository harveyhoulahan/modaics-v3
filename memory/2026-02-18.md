## 2026-02-18 — Modaics v3.5 Build Session (Night Shift)

### Harvey's Instructions:
- Mediterranean warmth aesthetic (keep v3.0 design)
- Merge v2.0's 25K items + working backend
- All-night build with agent swarm
- New zip file (/root/Modaics.zip, 1.45GB) transferring — analyze when arrives

### Agents Deployed & Completed:

| Agent | Runtime | Status | Delivered |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| v35-schema | 8m | ✅ | 768-dim models, payments, sketchbook |
| v35-services | 11m | ✅ | CLIP embeddings, search, payments, sketchbook |
| v35-migration | 9m | ✅ | Scripts to migrate 25K items + AI stories |
| v35-routers | 13m | ✅ | API endpoints (/search_by_image, payments, sketchbook) |
| v35-ios | 17m | ✅ | iOS 768-dim + API client |
| v35-testing | 17m | ✅ | Test suite + verification scripts |

### V3.5 Codebase: 56+ files
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + pgvector (768-dim)
- iOS: SwiftUI with Mediterranean warmth design
- Migration: Scripts to move 25K items with GPT story generation
- Testing: Full suite with performance benchmarks

### Key Decisions:
- Keep 768-dim embeddings (don't recompute 25K items)
- Preserve /search_by_image API (iOS compatibility)
- AI-generate stories for all existing items
- Merge sketchbook + payments from v2.0

### Waiting On:
- /root/Modaics.zip (1.45GB) — transferring via rsync
- Will unzip, analyze, extract data when arrives
- May update migration scripts if new data structure found

### Next Steps (Morning):
1. Unzip and analyze new codebase
2. Extract all data
3. Update migration if needed
4. Run full migration
5. Test everything
6. Report to Harvey
